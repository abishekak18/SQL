-- The UNION operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set.


-- create client table similar to branch table
-- CREATE TABLE clients (
-- client_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
-- location VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
-- addr VARCHAR(200) );

-- INSERT INTO clients VALUES(1,"NewYork","25 10th Block");
-- INSERT INTO clients VALUES(2,"Coimbatore","120 15th Block");
-- INSERT INTO clients VALUES(3,"London","21 ABC Road");

-- combines the two tables removing duplicates
SELECT * FROM branch
UNION                              --  Returns unique records (removes duplicates).
SELECT * FROM clients;


-- combines the two tables without removing duplicates
SELECT * FROM branch
UNION ALL                                     -- Returns all records, including duplicates (faster performance).
SELECT * FROM clients;
