-- A subquery is a query inside another SQL query. It is used to fetch data dynamically.

-- Displays employee list in Chennai Branch
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE branch_id = (SELECT branch_id
FROM branch
WHERE br_name="Chennai");


-- Displays the employees with min salary
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM employee);


-- EXISTS checks if a subquery returns any rows. It stops execution as soon as it finds a match (faster than IN).


-- displays the branches containing atleast one admin
SELECT branch_id,br_name
FROM branch
WHERE EXISTS 
( SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc="ADMIN" AND branch.branch_id = employee.branch_id);



--  ANY allows comparison with at least one value from a subquery. It acts like IN but works with comparison operators (=, >, <, etc.).

-- displays the branch info in which any employee gets more than 25L
SELECT branch_id,br_name
FROM branch
WHERE branch_id = ANY
(SELECT branch_id FROM employee
WHERE salary>2500000);



-- ALL compares a value with all the values from a subquery.

-- displays employees not working in chennai or coimbatore

SELECT * FROM employee 
WHERE branch_id <> ALL ( SELECT branch_id FROM branch
WHERE br_name IN ("Chennai","Coimbatore"));
