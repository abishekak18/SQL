-- A View --> In SQL is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically but provides a way to simplify complex queries and enhance security.

CREATE VIEW emp_br
AS
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

SELECT * FROM emp_br; -- selecting all rows from view

DROP VIEW emp_br; -- delete view
